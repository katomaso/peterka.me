Summary: Few golden rules about constructor implementation 

# Constructors

Disclaimer: I personally think that classes are being overused.
A simple function is more testable and elegant. Classes should
be used only when you need to keep state between two function calls.

## Constructor 

-  **must** setup *all* attributes representing class' state
-  **must not** setup attributes not important for class state
-  **must not** do any action besides setting attributes
-  **should** construct private attributes from the public ones

### Why?

Because of testability. For every class you are going to test you
need to know in what state it is. If a constructor was running some
functions in background you are not the one in control. That will
lead to potentially different class state with the same construct
parameters.

### I need runtime information because it defines state of class

No you do not. Runtime information should be obtained in runtime
by a function/method. Class state never depends on external runtime
states.

### How do I distinguish class-state and runtime attribute?

The rule of thumb for me is: *If you have used an attribute 
only once (or in one method) then it is a runtime information*.

When you put runtime information into attributes you will make
your app hard to extend and messy.


## Example

    class Computer:
        def __init__(self, ncpu, ram):
            # simple asignment is ok
            self.ram = ram

            # construct private attribute from a public one
            # I prefer to save the public one too in case of serialization/deserialization
            self.ncpu = ncpu
            self._cpu_list = [CPU(n) for n in range(ncpu)]

            # this should never happen
            # do NOT perform any actions in constructor
            self.constraintRAM(ram)


### When you put all runtime information into attributes

    class Computer:

        def __init__(self,
                     software_root,
                     instance_root,
