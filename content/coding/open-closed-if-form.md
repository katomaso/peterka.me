Title: Open and Closed form of Control Structure IF
Category: Coding
Date: 2017-05-10
Summary: IF is a tricky statement to get right from the semantic point of view. Please use open form when possible to save cyclomatic complexity and developer's eyes.

When writing if prefer "closed" form instead of "open" form.

    # open form
    if some_condiditon:
      do_something()

    # closed form
    if not some_condition():
      return
    do_something()

Closed form gives you clear idea which parts of code gets executed under what
circumstances.

## Open form

Leads naturally to deeper code which is unreadable for ordinary humans
like me. Imagine more conditioned example. Are you able to state what are
necessary conditions for do_C and do_D to run?

    # deep open form
    if condition_A:
      do_A()
      if condition_B:
        do_B()
      else:
        if condition_C:
          do_C()
      do_D()


## Closed form

Encourages flat structure and returning / breaking
the code early. I decided to repeat do_D() in the last two ifs for the sake of
readability. Once you extract code in a function it is not a crime to call the
function on many places. That is why you extract functionality into functions.

    if not condition_A:
      return
    do_A()

    if condition_B:
      do_B()
      do_D()
      return

    if condition_C:
      do_C()
      do_D()
      return

Compare again your ability to state under which conditions do_C() and do_D() run.


Some rules of thumb how to spot open forms

1.  Your IFs are being folded too much
1.  You have many (any) ELSEs
