Did you get splashed by the blockchain hype? Me too. Let's take a step back
and evaluate the technology.

First, it is necessary to say that it is indeed a revolution. As my friend from
banking sector said

Blockchain is currently not-that-useful for the end-user. There are concepts
of payment, resource sharing, legal contract, and asset ownership management.

## Payment
It is true that peak global concensus is 7 transaction/second. But it is a *GLOBAL* consensus!
It is obviously not meant for recording every grocery payment. Lightning Network partitions
current flat global network into local subnetworks. With such a technology, any blockchain
based currency can become a standard payment method. Provided that everyone is capable of
participating in the network! People need to get used to having a home server or a trusted peer.

## Resource Sharing

## Legal Contract

## Ownership
