As a big fan of Chromebooks, my first lust regards were towards Chromebook shelves. And there I
did find some nice machines such as Acer Flip 5 and others. Unfortunately, the one I was aiming
for the most - the HP Wildfly was not available for such a long time that I had to shut my hopes
and turn in other direction.

ChromeOS is incredibly lightweight system. After introduction of containers, you would get a seamless
integration with fully writable Linux OS together with all of its graphical applications. You
could even launch a Firefox if you wanted. The issue was that those containers did not support
certain SYSCALLs (something with NodeJS) thus I was forced to abandon this approach since my primary
usage is programming. The final blow was that my favorite video editing software Clipchamp got
acquired by Microsoft and make available for free on Windows.

As a life-long Linux user, certain hate towards Microsoft was by default inside my hearth. Truth
to be said - I grew pragmatic and got a bigger budget compared when being a student. I don't mind
paying for an OS if it is worth the price. Windows XP were and recent Windows 10+ are as well.
Together with the awesome hardware that Surface laptops are, the choice was easy.

Just to be fully understand. If MacBooks had touchscreen and the OS less clumsy and child-like,
I would definitely go in that direction. Even Linuxes are quite alright with System76 laptops.

EDIT: I got Microsoft Surgace Go Laptop 2 because it is a MacBook Pro with touchscreen. Luckily,
Windows 11 got much better and MacOS worse or the same (and in this field staying the same means
getting worse).

EDIT: I just took a look on https://system76.com/laptops/oryx and I started regretting my choice.
On the other hand - my Surface Go is incredibly lightweight and sturdy hence no regrets regarding
carrying it while travelling. And boy did I travel a lot. I even climbed 3.5km mountain with a
backpack still containing my laptop.
