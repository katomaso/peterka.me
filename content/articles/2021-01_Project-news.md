Title: New interesting projects
Description: Let's take a look on project management and automatization tools that will help your company to thrive. I will always try to add a Czech
alternative to the potentially global version so you see that Czech software is actually pretty good.

# Project management

## Pivotal Tracker
Some 10 yeats ago, I was extremely happy using [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). The best PM tool ever made; later acquired by Google to
prove my words. Since then, I couldn't comprehend people deliberately making their work-life miserable with JIRA. It seems to look still the same. To give
them credit - they were the first tool to implement agile project management.

## Notion PM
I hope you know [Notion](https://notion.so) - an app that took the world by storm produced by 4 people in total I think. As the name might imply, it started
as a simple notes taking tool some few years back. It happened to be so versatile and free-editing experience (something line One Note by M$) that it gained
a lot of traction from the beginning. And the developers realized what was the key to success. The versatility. Today, you can manage whole project just using
Notion. You can add some custom templates, just like what [Notion PM](https://www.slashmint.com/notion-pm) offers.

## Ten projekt na ktery si nemuzu vzpomenout

A Czech product, incredible customer support by its founder. Great price, amazing flexibility and usability. Why I cannot remember nor find the project? Damn it.

# Atomation

## Google Workflows

Google just released a graphical tool called [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/get-to-know-google-cloud-workflows) that
fits well with GCP (Google Cloud Platform) by using it's Cloud Functions. Naturaly, this was an inevitable step for wider adoption of cloud and cloud-based
computers such as my favourite ChromeBooks.

## Integromat
