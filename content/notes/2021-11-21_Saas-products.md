Title: The most important SaaS products for a comencing startup

I've been living off solo SaaS products my entire adult life -- almost 20 years. These are the only services I pay for:
* AWS and Cloudflare for hosting
* Rackspace for incoming email
* Sendgrid for transactional/outbound email
* Namecheap for domains
* A merchant account and Spreedly for payments
* ShareASale to run an affiliate program and pay a percentage commission for referred sales
* Facebook and Google ads
