Summary: First contribution fixing CWD

I operate on many computers at once. I cannot rely on any particular set of
applications being installed localy. One has to move to cloud.

One of important weblication to have is an IDE. I did evaluate few of publicaly
available ones.

  - [http://codiad.com/](Codiad IDE) is a LAMP based tool which is surprisingly
  mature. Unfortunately I am biased against PHP applications thus not my choice.

  - [https://jupyter.org/](Jupyter LAB) is python based IDE supporting direct
  editing of arbitrary files, viewing formats such as CSV, running terminal
  sessions and finaly running live code with multiple backends. I personally
  use it for editing articles on my blog and for small experiments.

  - [https://github.com/b3log/wide](Wide) is a Golang IDE. It is written in Go itself.
  It has support for realtime remote execution via Web Sockets.
